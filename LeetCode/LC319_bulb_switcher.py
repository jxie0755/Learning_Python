# LC319 Bulb Switcher
# Medium


# There are n bulbs that are initially off.
# You first turn on all the bulbs.
# Then, you turn off every second bulb.
# On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it"s off or turning off if it"s on).
# For the i-th round, you toggle every i bulb. For the n-th round, you only toggle the last bulb.

# Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.
